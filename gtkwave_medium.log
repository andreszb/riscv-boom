Warning! File size is 378 MB.  This might fail in recoding.
Consider converting it to the FST database format instead.  (See the
vcd2fst(1) manpage for more information.)
To disable this warning, set rc variable vcd_warning_filesize to zero.
Alternatively, use the -o, --optimize command line option to convert to FST
or the -g, --giga command line option to use dynamically compressed memory.
